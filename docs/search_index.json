Understanding the essence of such relationships  that is, identifying causal mechanisms that facilitate correlation among economic variables  is at the core of econometric analysis. Throughout a relatively brief history of the study of econometrics, numerous methods and techniques have been proposed and developed  all aimed to give an empirical content to economic models. These methods and techniques allow us to test theories, evaluate policy outcomes, etc. Econometric models rely on correct (and accurate) identification of the causal mechanism in the underlying process. But they are also predictive by nature  they help us make economic forecasts even when the causal mechanism may not be well identified. In other words, while correlation does not necessarily imply causality, if the goal is to make a forecast, a mere correlation might as well suffice. Roots of forecasting extend very much to the beginning of human history. In their desire to predict the future, people have attempted to make forecasts of their own, or have used services of others. Fortunetellers, for example, have been forecast experts of some sort, basing their predictions on magic. They are less common in the current age. Astrologers, who rely on astronomical phenomena to foresee the future, maintain their relevance to this date. Over time, and particularly with the development of the study of econometrics, more rigorous forecasting methods have been introduced and developed. All methods  primitive or complex, spurious or scientifically substantiated  have one thing in common: they all rely (or, at least, pretend to rely) on information. Information is key in forecasting. It comes in many forms, but after it is organized and stored, what we end up with is data. A diverse set of forecasting methods typically rely on insights from econometric analysis of time series  chronologically stored data, collected at regular intervals over a period of time. In time series analysis, the implied assumption is that the past tends to repeat itself, at least to some extent. So, if we well study the past, we may be able to forecast an event with some degree of accuracy. Accurate forecasting is difficult. No matter how rich the available data are, or how well the econometric model fits the data, there still is a surprise element concerning the forecast  something that has never happened in past, and is only specific to the future. And because of this, there is no such thing as precise forecast, even if by fluke we were to exactly predict an outcome of an event. But some forecasts are better than others. And in search of such forecasts the study of time series econometrics has evolved. "],["stochastic-process-and-time-series.html", "Chapter 2 Stochastic Process and Time Series 2.1 Stationarity 2.2 Serial Dependence 2.3 Transformations", " Chapter 2 Stochastic Process and Time Series Time series are realizations of a chronologically stored sequence of random variables. This sequence of random variables is referred to as the stochastic process. Thus, a time series is a realisation of the stochastic process. We index time periods as \\(1,2,\\ldots,T\\), and denote the set of observations as \\(\\{y_1,\\ldots,y_T\\}\\). One can view a time series as a finite sample from an underlying doublyinfinite sequence: \\(\\{\\ldots,y_{-1},y_{0},y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_T,y_{T+1},y_{T+2},\\ldots\\}\\). 2.1 Stationarity If all random variables, from where the time series are drawn, have the same distribution, then we refert to such time series as stationary. Stationarity is an important feature, and the assumption, on which the time series analysis heavily relies. Before diving any further into the concepts and methods of time series econometrics, consider the simplest kind of time series comprised of realizations from independent and identically distributed random variable with zero mean and constant variance: \\(\\varepsilon_t \\sim iid\\left(0,\\sigma^2\\right)\\). The following graph plots this time series against time. Figure 2.1: White noise: an illustration Such time series are referred to as white noise. That is, a time series, \\(y\\), is a white noise process if: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; E(y_t) = 0,\\;~\\forall~t\\\\ &amp; Var(y_t) = \\sigma^2,\\;~\\forall~t\\\\ &amp; Cov(y_t,y_{t-k}) = 0,\\;~\\forall~k \\ne 0 \\end{align*}\\] Because each observation is drawn from the same distribution, white noise is a stationary time series. Indeed, it is a special type of stationary time series insofar as its mean, variance, and covariance are time-invariant. Note, for a time series to be stationary, the mean doesnt need to be zero (as long as it is constant over time), nor covariances need to be equal to zero (as long as they are constant over time, though they may vary with \\(k\\)). Thus, \\(\\{y_t\\}\\) is stationary if the mean and variance are independent of \\(t\\), and the autocovariances are independent of \\(t\\) for all \\(k\\). 2.2 Serial Dependence In fact, it is more of a norm rather than an exception for a time series to be correlated over time. Indeed, because of the sequential nature of time series, we commonly observe dependence among the temporally adjacent time series. That is, for most economic time series, we would expect \\(y_t\\) and \\(y_{t-1}\\) to be correlated. Such correlations are referred to as autocorrelations, and are given by: \\[\\rho_k=Cor(y_t,y_{t-k}) = \\frac{Cov(y_t,y_{t-k})}{Var(y_t)},\\;~~k=1,2,\\ldots\\] Autocorrelations are commonly illustrated via the so-called autocorrelogram, which plots the sequence of autocorrelation coefficients against the lags at which these coefficients are obtained. For example, an autocorrelogram of the previously illustrated white noise process is as follows: Figure 2.2: Autocorrelation For each \\(k\\), the vertical line extending from zero represents the autocorrelation coefficient at that lag. The red dashed lines denote the 90% confidence interval, given by \\(\\pm 1.96/\\sqrt{T}\\), where \\(T\\) is the length of the time series. Another relevant measure for time series dependence is partial autocorrelation, which is correlation between \\(y_t\\) and \\(y_{t-k}\\) net of any correlations between \\(y_t\\) and \\(y_{t-k+j}\\), for all \\(j=1,\\ldots,k-1\\). Similar to autocorrelations, partial autocorrelations can also be illustrated using autocorrelograms: Figure 2.3: Partial Autocorrelation 2.3 Transformations It is common to transform time series by taking logarithms, differences, or differences of logarithms (growth rates). Such transformations usually are done to work with the suitable variable for the desired econometric analysis. For example, if an economic time series is characterized by an apparent exponential growth (e.g., real GDP), by taking natural logarithms the time series ``flatten and the fluctuations become proportionate. The difference operator is denoted by \\(\\Delta\\), so that \\(\\Delta y_t = y_t-y_{t-1}\\). The following three graphs illustrate (i) a time series with an apparent exponential growth, (ii) the natural logarithm of this time series, and (iii) their differences (i.e., the log-differences of the original series). Figure 2.4: A time series and its transformations "],["basics-of-forecasting.html", "Chapter 3 Basics of Forecasting 3.1 Optimal Forecast 3.2 Measuring Forecast Accuracy 3.3 Evaluating Time Series Forecasts", " Chapter 3 Basics of Forecasting 3.1 Optimal Forecast A forecast is a random variable which has some distribution and, thus, moments. The simplest form of a forecast is a point forecast (usually a mean of the distribution, but can be a median or, indeed, any quantile). A point forecast made in period \\(t\\) for horizon \\(h\\) can be denoted as \\(y_{t+h|t}\\); this is our best guess, that is made in period \\(t\\), about the actual realization of the random variable in period \\(t+h\\), denoted by \\(y_{t+h}\\). The difference between the two is the forecast error. That is, \\[e_{t+h|t} = y_{t+h} - y_{t+h|t}\\] The more accurate is the forecast the smaller is the forecast error. Three types of uncertainty contribute to the forecast error: \\[\\begin{aligned} e_{t+h|t} &amp; = \\big[y_{t+h}-E(y_{t+h}|\\Omega_{t})\\big]\\;~~\\text{(forecast uncertainty)} \\\\ &amp; + \\big[E(y_{t+h}|\\Omega_{t}) - g(\\Omega_{t};\\theta)\\big]\\;~~\\text{(model uncertainty)} \\\\ &amp; + \\big[g(\\Omega_{t};\\theta)-g(\\Omega_{t};\\hat{\\theta})\\big]\\;~~\\text{(parameter uncertainty)} \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\Omega_t\\) denotes the information set available at the time when the forecast is made; \\(g(\\cdot)\\) is a functional form of a model used to fit the data; \\(\\theta\\) is a set of parameters of the model, and \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) are their estimates Because uncertainty cannot be avoided, a forecaster is bound to commit forecast errors. The goal of the forecaster is to minimize the cost associated with the forecast errors. This is achieved by minimizing the expected loss function. A loss function, \\(L(e_{t+h|t})\\), can take many different forms, but is should satisfy the following properties: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; L(e_{t+h|t}) = 0,\\;~~\\forall\\;e_{t+h|t} = 0 \\\\ &amp; L(e_{t+h|t}) \\geq 0,\\;~~\\forall\\;e_{t+h|t} \\neq 0 \\\\ &amp; L(e_{t+h|t}^{(i)}) &gt; L(e_{t+h|t}^{(j)}),\\;~~\\forall\\;|e_{t+h|t}^{(i)}| &gt; |e_{t+h|t}^{(j)}| \\end{aligned}\\] Two commonly used symmetric loss functions are absolute and quadratic loss functions: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; L{(e_{t+h|t})} = |e_{t+h|t}|\\;~~\\text{(absolute loss function)} \\\\ &amp; L{(e_{t+h|t})} = (e_{t+h|t})^2\\;~~\\text{(quadratic loss function)} \\end{aligned}\\] The quadratic loss function is popular, partly because we typically select models based on in-sample quadratic loss (i.e. by minimizing the sum of squared residuals). Optimal forecast is the forecast that minimizes the expected loss: \\[\\min_{y_{t+h|t}} E\\left[L\\left(e_{t+h|t}\\right)\\right] = \\min_{y_{t+h|t}} E\\left[L\\left(y_{t+h}-y_{t+h|t}\\right)\\right]\\] where the expected loss is given by: \\[E\\left[L\\left(y_{t+h}-y_{t+h|t}\\right)\\right]=\\int L\\left(y_{t+h}-y_{t+h|t}\\right) f(y_{t+h}|\\Omega_t)dy\\] We can assume that the conditional density is a normal density with mean \\(\\mu_{t+h} \\equiv E(y_{t+h})\\), and variance \\(\\sigma_{t+h}^2 \\equiv Var(y_{t+h})\\). Under the assumption of the quadratic loss function: \\[\\begin{aligned} E\\left[L(e_{t+h|t})\\right] &amp; = E(e_{t+h|t}^2) = E(y_{t+h} - \\hat{y}_{t+h|t})^2 \\\\ &amp; = E(y_{t+h}^2)-2E(y_{t+h})\\hat{y}_{t+h|t} + \\hat{y}_{t+h|t}^2 \\end{aligned}\\] By solving the optimization problem it follows that: \\[\\hat{y}_{t+h|t} = E(y_{t+h}) \\equiv \\mu_{t+h}\\] Thus, the optimal point forecast under the quadratic loss is the mean (for reference, the optimal point forecast under absolute loss is the median). 3.2 Measuring Forecast Accuracy Forecast accuracy should only be determined by considering how well a model performs on data not used in estimation. But to assess forecast accuracy we need access to the data, typically from future time periods, that was not used in estimation. This leads to the so-called pseudo forecasting routine. This routine involves splitting the available data into two segments referred to as in-sample and out-of-sample. The in-sample segment of a series is also known as the estimation set or the training set. The out-of-sample segment of a series is also known as the hold-out set or the test set. Thus, we make the so-called genuine forecasts using only the information from the estimation set, and assess the accuracy of these forecasts in an out-of-sample setting. Because forecasting is often performed in a time series context, the estimation set typically predates the hold-out set. In non-dynamic settings such chronological ordering may not be necessary, however. There are different forecasting schemes for updating the information set in the pseudo-forecasting routine. These are: recursive, rolling, and fixed. The recursive forecasting environment uses a sequence of expanding windows to update model estimates and the information set. The rolling forecasting environment uses a sequence of rolling windows of the same size to update model estimates and the information set. The fixed forecasting environment uses one fixed window for model estimates, and only updates the information set. 3.3 Evaluating Time Series Forecasts To evaluate forecasts of a time series, \\(\\{y_t\\}\\), with a total of \\(T\\) observations, we divide the sample into two parts, the in-sample set with a total of \\(R\\) observations, such that \\(R &lt; T\\) (typically, \\(R \\approx 0.75T\\)), and the out-of-sample set. For example, if we are interested in one-step-ahead forecast assessment, this way we will produce a sequence of forecasts: \\(\\{y_{R+1|R},y_{R+2|{R+1}},\\ldots,y_{T|{T-1}}\\}\\) for \\(\\{Y_{R+1},Y_{R+2},\\ldots,Y_{T}\\}\\). Forecast errors, \\(e_{R+j} = y_{R+j} - y_{R+j|{R+j-1}}\\), then can be computed for \\(j = 1,\\ldots,T-R\\). The most commonly applied accuracy measures are the mean absolute forecast error (MAFE) and the root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE): \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{MAFE} = &amp; \\frac{1}{P}\\sum_{i=1}^{P}|e_i|\\\\ \\text{RMSFE} = &amp; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{P}\\sum_{i=1}^{P}e_i^2} \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(P\\) is the total number of out-of-sample forecasts. The lower is the accuracy measure (of choice), the better a given model performs in generating accurate forecasts. As noted earlier, better does not mean without errors. Forecast errors of a good forecasting method will have the following properties: zero mean; otherwise, the forecasts are biased. no correlation with the forecasts; otherwise, there is information left that should be used in computing forecasts. no serial correlation among one-step-ahead forecast errors. Note that \\(k\\)-step-ahead forecasts, for \\(k&gt;1\\), can be, and usually are, serially correlated. Any forecasting method that does not satisfy these properties has a potential to be improved. 3.3.1 Unbiasedness Testing \\(E(e_{t+h|t})=0\\). Set up a regression: \\[e_{t+h|t} = \\alpha+\\upsilon_{t+h} \\hspace{.5in} t = R,\\ldots,T-h,\\] where \\(R\\) is the estimation window size, \\(T\\) is the sample size, and \\(h\\) is the forecast horizon length. The null of zero-mean forecast error is equivalent of testing \\(H_0: \\alpha = 0\\) in the OLS setting. For \\(h\\)-step-ahead forecast errors, when \\(h&gt;1\\), autocorrelation consistent standard errors should be used. 3.3.2 Efficiency Testing \\(Cov(e_{t+h|t},y_{t+h|t})=0\\). Set up a regression: \\[e_{t+h|t} = \\alpha + \\beta y_{t+h|t} + \\upsilon_{t+h} \\hspace{.5in} t = R,\\ldots,T-h.\\] The null of forecast error independence of the information set is equivalent of testing \\(H_0: \\beta = 0\\) in the OLS setting. For \\(h\\)-step-ahead forecast errors, when \\(h&gt;1\\), autocorrelation consistent standard errors should be used. 3.3.3 No Autocorrelation Testing \\(Cov(e_{t+1|t},e_{t|t-1})=0\\). Set up a regression: \\[e_{t+1|t} = \\alpha + \\gamma e_{t|t-1} + \\upsilon_{t+1} \\hspace{.5in} t = R+1,\\ldots,T-1.\\] The null of no forecast error autocorrelation is equivalent of testing \\(H_0: \\gamma = 0\\) in the OLS setting. "],["deterministic-time-series-models.html", "Deterministic Time Series Models", " Deterministic Time Series Models "],["trends.html", "Chapter 4 Trends 4.1 Spurious Relationship 4.2 Modeling 4.3 Forecasting", " Chapter 4 Trends Economic time series usually are characterized by trending behavior, and often present a seasonal pattern as well. Trend is a unidirectional change of time series over an extended period of time that arises from the accumulation of information over time. Seasonality is a repeating pattern within a calendar year that arises from the links of technologies, preferences, and institutions to the calendar. Modeling and forecasting these time series features is a fairly straightforward task. But before we get to it, lets discuss what may happen if we were to ignore the presence of trends and/or seasonality when analyzing the time series data. 4.1 Spurious Relationship Nothing about trending time series necessarily violates the classical linear regression model assumptions. The issue may arise, however, if an unobserved trending variable is simultaneously correlated with the dependent variable as well as one of the independent variables in a time series regression. In such case, we may find a (statistically significant) relationship between two or more unrelated economic variables simply because they are all trending. Such relationship is referred to a spurious relationship. To illustrate, consider two trending variables: \\[y_t = \\gamma t + \\nu_t,\\;~~\\nu\\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\nu}^2),\\] and \\[x_t = \\delta t + \\upsilon_t,\\;~~\\upsilon\\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\upsilon}^2),\\] where \\(Cov(\\nu_t,\\upsilon_t) = 0\\). For simplicity, we can assume \\(\\sigma_{\\nu}^2=\\sigma_{\\upsilon}^2=1\\). Suppose, \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\delta\\) are some positive scalars, say, \\(0.3\\) and \\(0.5\\), respectively. That is, \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are trending in the same direction. Below is an example of such time series: If we were to estimate \\[y_t = \\alpha+\\beta x_t + \\varepsilon_t,\\] we are likely to find the relationship between the two  in this case \\(\\beta&gt;0\\)  even though, we know, the two are not related. To illustrate this, we will generate 1000 samples of size 120 for \\(y\\) and \\(x\\), and in each case we will estimate the parameter \\(\\beta\\). The following graph illustrates the empirical distribution of these parameter estimates: Luckily, we can easily fix the issue, by incorporating a trend in the regression: \\[y_t = \\alpha+\\beta x_t + \\eta t + \\varepsilon_t.\\] Once the trend is accounted for, the previously illustrated bias disappears. Using a similar simulation exercise as before, the following graph illustrates the empirical distribution of these parameter estimates: In fact, this fix is equivalent to regressing a de-trended \\(y\\) on a de-trended \\(x\\). To de-trend a variable, we first run a regression: \\(y_t = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 t + \\nu_t\\), and then obtain the fitted values for some fixed trend (typically zero), that is: \\(\\tilde{y}_t = \\hat{\\gamma}_0+\\hat{\\nu}_t\\), where \\(\\hat{\\gamma}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\nu}_t\\) are the parameter estimate and the residuals from the foregoing regression. 4.2 Modeling As seen, accounting for trends in a time series can help us resolve some regression issues. But a trend in and of itself can be an inherent feature of a times series. To that end, we can apply deterministic trends to forecast time series. The simplest (and perhaps most frequently applied) model to account for the trending time series is a linear trend model: \\[y_t = \\alpha + \\beta t\\] Other likely candidate trend specifications are polynomial (e.g. quadratic, cubic, etc.), exponential, and shifting (or switching) trend models, respectively given by: \\[\\begin{aligned} y_t &amp;= \\alpha + \\beta_1 t + \\beta_2 t^2 + \\ldots + \\beta_p t^p \\\\ y_t &amp;= e^{\\alpha + \\beta t}\\;~~\\mbox{or}\\;~~\\ln{y_t} = \\alpha + \\beta t \\\\ y_t &amp;= \\alpha + \\beta_1 t + \\beta_2 (t-\\tau)I(t&gt;\\tau),\\;~~\\tau\\in\\mathsf{T} \\end{aligned}\\] Of these, here we will primarily consider linear and quadratic trends. An exponential trend, from the standpoint of modeling and forecasting, is equivalent to a linear trend fitted to natural logarithm of the series. For a time series \\(\\{y_t: t=1,\\ldots,T\\}\\), the natural logarithm is: \\(z_t = \\ln{y_t}\\). Some of the benefits of such a transformation are that: they are easier to interpret (relative/percentage change). they homogenizes the variance of the time series. they may result in improved forecasting accuracy. Exponential trends are suitable when a time series is characterized by a stable relative change over time (e.g., when economic time series grow by 2% every year). We will cover the shifting/switching trend models in another chapter. Trends are (relatively) easy to model and forecast. Caution is needed, however, with (higher order) polynomial trends, as they may fit well in-sample, but cause major problems out-of-sample. Consider a linear trend model with an additive error term: \\[y_t = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\varepsilon_t\\] We estimate the model parameters, \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}=\\{\\alpha,\\beta\\}\\), by fitting the trend model to a time series using the least-squares regression: \\[\\hat{\\theta} = \\operatorname*{argmin}_{\\mathbf{\\theta}} \\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\big(y_t - \\alpha - \\beta t\\big)^2.\\] Fitted values are then given by: \\[\\hat{y}_t = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta} t\\] 4.3 Forecasting If a linear trend model is fitted to the data, then any future realization of the stochastic process is assumed to follow the linear trend model: \\[y_{t+h} = \\alpha + \\beta (t+h) + \\varepsilon_{t+h}.\\] An optimal forecast of \\(y_{t+h}\\), therefore, is given by: \\[y_{t+h|t} = E(y_{t+h}|\\Omega_t) = E[\\alpha + \\beta (t+h) + \\varepsilon_{t+h}] = \\alpha + \\beta (t+h).\\] The forecast error is: \\[e_{t+h|t} = y_{t+h} - y_{t+h|t} = \\varepsilon_{t+h}\\] The forecast variance, then, is: \\[\\sigma_{t+h|t}^2 = E(e_{t+h|t}^2) = E(\\varepsilon_{t+h}^2) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2,\\;~~\\forall\\;h\\] From this, we can obtain interval forecast at any horizon, which is: \\[y_{t+h|t} \\pm 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}.\\] A few features of trend forecasts to note: they tend to understate uncertainty (at long horizons as the forecast interval doesn not widen with the horizon); short-term trend forecasts can perform poorly; long-term trend forecasts typically perform poorly; sometimes it may be beneficial, from the standpoint of achieving better accuracy, to forecast growth rates, and then reconstruct level forecasts. "],["seasonality.html", "Chapter 5 Seasonality 5.1 Modeling 5.2 Forecasting", " Chapter 5 Seasonality Seasonality is typically modeled as monthly or quarterly pattern, but can also be modeled as a higher frequency pattern (e.g. weekly). Some examples of time series with apparent seasonal patterns are: Agricultural production. Sales of energy products. Airfare (in non-pandemic times). One way to deal with the seasonality in data is to remove it prior to the use of the series (i.e., work with a seasonally adjusted time series). Indeed, some economic time series are only/also available in a seasonally-adjusted form. Otherwise, and perhaps more interestingly, we can directly model seasonality in a regression setting by incorporating seasonal dummy variables. 5.1 Modeling A seasonal model is given by: \\[y_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{s}\\gamma_i d_{it} + \\varepsilon_t,\\] where \\(s\\) denotes the frequency of the data, and \\(d_{it}\\) takes the value of 1 repeatedly after every \\(s\\) periods, and such that \\(\\sum_{i} d_{it} = 1\\), \\(\\forall t\\). Alternatively the seasonal model can be rewritten as: \\[y_t = \\alpha + \\sum_{i=1}^{s-1}\\delta_i d_{it} + \\varepsilon_t,\\] in which case \\(\\alpha\\) is an intercept of an omitted season, and \\(\\delta_i\\) represents a deviation from it during the \\(i^{th}\\) season. Both variants of a seasonal model result in an identical fit and forecasts. 5.2 Forecasting Any future realization of a random variable that i assumed to follow a seasonal model is: \\[y_{t+h} = \\alpha + \\sum_{i=1}^{s-1}\\delta_i d_{i,t+h} + \\varepsilon_{t+h}.\\] The optimal forecast of \\(y_{t+h}\\) is: \\[y_{t+h|t} = E(y_{t+h}|\\Omega_t) = \\alpha + \\sum_{i=1}^{s-1}\\delta_i d_{i,t+h}\\] The forecast error is: \\[e_{t+h|t} = y_{t+h} - y_{t+h|t} = \\varepsilon_{t+h}\\] The forecast variance is given by: \\[\\sigma_{t+h|t}^2 = E(e_{t+h|t}^2) = E(\\varepsilon_{t+h}^2) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2,\\;~~\\forall\\;h\\] The interval forecast at any horizon is: \\[y_{t+h|t} \\pm 1.96 \\hat{\\sigma}.\\] "],["dynamic-time-series-models.html", "Dynamic Time Series Models", " Dynamic Time Series Models "],["linear-autoregression.html", "Chapter 6 Linear Autoregression 6.1 Modeling 6.2 Forecasting", " Chapter 6 Linear Autoregression Economic time series are often characterized by stochastic cycles. A cycle is a pattern of periodic fluctuations, not contained within a calendar year. A stochastic cycle is one generated by random variables. In general terms, the process is given by: \\[Y_t = f(Y_{t-1},Y_{t-2},\\ldots;\\mathbf{\\theta})+\\varepsilon_t.\\;~~t=1,\\ldots,T\\] An autoregressive process (or, simply, an autoregression) is a regression in which the dependent variable and the regressors belong to the same stochastic process. An autoregression of order \\(p\\), denoted as \\(AR(p)\\), has the following functional form: \\[y_t = \\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t-1}+\\beta_2 y_{t-2}+ \\cdots + \\beta_p y_{t-p}+\\varepsilon_t\\] The sum of the autoregressive parameters, \\(\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_p\\), depicts the persistence of the series. The larger is the persistence (i.e., closer it is to one), the longer it takes for the effect of a shock to dissolve. The effect will, eventually, dissolve so long as the series are covariance-stationary. The autocorrelation, \\(\\rho\\), and partial autocorrelation, \\(\\pi\\), functions of the covariance-stationary \\(AR(p)\\) process have the following distinctive features: \\(\\rho_1 = \\pi_1\\), and \\(\\pi_p = \\beta_p\\). The values of \\(\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_p\\) determine the shape of the autocorrelation function (ACF); in any case, the smaller (in absolute terms) is the persistence measure, the faster the ACF decays toward zero. The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is characterized by statistically significant first \\(p\\) spikes \\(\\pi_1 \\neq 0,\\ldots,\\pi_p \\neq 0\\), and the remaining \\(\\pi_k = 0\\), \\(\\forall k &gt; p\\). 6.1 Modeling 6.1.1 AR(1) The first-order autoregression is given by: \\[y_t = \\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t,\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant term; \\(\\beta_1\\) is the persistence parameter; and \\(\\varepsilon_t\\) is a white noise process. A necessary and sufficient condition for an \\(AR(1)\\) process to be covariance stationary is that \\(|\\beta_1| &lt; 1\\). We can see this by substituting recursively the lagged equations into the lagged dependent variables: \\[ \\begin{aligned} y_t &amp;= \\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t \\notag \\\\ y_t &amp;= \\alpha + \\beta_1 (\\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_{t-1}) + \\varepsilon_t \\notag \\\\ &amp;= \\alpha(1+\\beta_1) + \\beta_1^2 (\\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t-3} + \\varepsilon_{t-2}) + \\beta_1\\varepsilon_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t \\notag \\\\ &amp;\\vdots \\notag \\\\ &amp;= \\alpha\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\\beta_1^i + \\beta_1^k y_{t-k} + \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\\beta_1^i\\varepsilon_{t-i} \\end{aligned} \\] The end-result is a general linear process with geometrically declining coefficients. Here, \\(|\\beta_1| &lt; 1\\) is required for convergence. Assuming \\(|\\beta_1| &lt; 1\\), as \\(k \\to \\infty\\) the process converges to: \\[y_t = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\beta_1} + \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}\\beta_1^i\\varepsilon_{t-i}\\] The unconditional mean of this process is: \\[\\mu = E\\left(y_t\\right) = E\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\beta_1} + \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}\\beta_1^i\\varepsilon_{t-i}\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\beta_1}\\] The unconditional variance of this process is: \\[\\gamma_0 = Var\\left(y_t\\right) = Var\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\beta_1} + \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}\\beta_1^i\\varepsilon_{t-i}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^2}{1-\\beta_1^2}\\] The Autocovariance is simply the covariance between \\(y_t\\) and \\(y_{t-k}\\), that is: \\[\\gamma_k = Cov(y_t,y_{t-k}) = E[(y_t - \\mu)(y_{t-k} - \\mu)] = E(y_t y_{t-k}) - \\mu^2\\] Some algebraic manipulation can help us show that: \\[\\gamma_k = \\beta_1\\gamma_{k-1},\\] and that: \\[\\rho_{k} = \\beta_1\\rho_{k-1}\\] (recall, \\(\\rho_k = \\gamma_k/\\gamma_0\\) is the autocorrelation coefficient). In fact, for AR(1), an autocorrelation coefficient of some lag can be represented as the autoregression parameter (which in this instance is equivalent to the persistence measure) to that power. That is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\rho_1 &amp;= \\beta_1\\rho_0 = \\beta_1 \\notag \\\\ \\rho_2 &amp;= \\beta_1\\rho_1 = \\beta_1^2 \\notag \\\\ &amp;\\vdots \\notag \\\\ \\rho_k &amp;= \\beta_1\\rho_{k-1} = \\beta_1^k \\end{aligned} \\] It follows that the autocorrelation function of a covariance stationary AR(1) is a geometric decay; the smaller is \\(|\\beta_1|\\) the more rapid is the decay. By imposing certain restrictions, the AR(1) will reduce to other already known models: If \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\), \\(y_t\\) is equivalent to a white noise. If \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\alpha = 0\\), \\(y_t\\) is a random walk. If \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\alpha \\neq 0\\), \\(y_t\\) is a random walk with drift. In general, a smaller persistence parameter results in a quicker adjustment to the unconditional mean of the process. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the AR(1) process have three distinctive features: \\(\\rho_1 = \\pi_1 = \\beta_1\\). That is, the persistence parameter is also the autocorrelation and the partial autocorrelation coefficient. The autocorrelation function decreases exponentially toward zero, and the decay is faster when the persistence parameter is smaller. The partial autocorrelation function is characterized by only one spike \\(\\pi_1 \\neq 0\\), and the remaining \\(\\pi_k = 0\\), \\(\\forall k &gt; 1\\). To illustrate the foregoing, lets generate a series of 100 observations that follow the process: \\(y_t=0.8y_{t-1}+\\varepsilon_t\\), where \\(y_0=0\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\sim N(0,1)\\), and plot the ACF and PACF of this series. 6.1.2 AR(2) Now consider the second-order autoregression: \\[y_t = \\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t-1} + \\beta_2 y_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_t\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant term; \\(\\beta_1+\\beta_2\\) is the persistence measure; and \\(\\varepsilon_t\\) is a white noise process. In what follows, the necessary (1 and 2) and sufficient (3 and 4) conditions for an \\(AR(2)\\) process to be covariance stationary are: \\(|\\beta_2| &lt; 1\\) \\(|\\beta_1| &lt; 2\\) \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 &lt; 1\\) \\(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1 &lt; 1\\) The autocorrelation functions of the AR(2) process have the following distinctive features: \\(\\rho_1 = \\pi_1\\) (which is true for any \\(AR(p)\\) process), and \\(\\pi_2 = \\beta_2\\). The autocorrelation function decreases toward zero. The path, however, varies depending on the values of \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\). Nonetheless, the decay is faster when the persistence measure is smaller. The partial autocorrelation function is characterized by only two spikes \\(\\pi_1 \\neq 0\\) and \\(\\pi_2 \\neq 0\\), and the remaining \\(\\pi_k = 0\\), \\(\\forall k &gt; 2\\). Again, to illustrate, lets generate a series of 100 observations that follow the process: \\(y_t=1.1y_{t-1}-0.4y_{t-2}+\\varepsilon_t\\), where \\(y_{-1}=y_0=0\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\sim N(0,1)\\), and plot the ACF and PACF of this series. 6.2 Forecasting Making forecasts for some future period, \\(t+h\\), from an AR(p) model that has been fit to the data up to and including period \\(t+h-1\\) can be a straightforward exercise, so long as we have access to the relevant information set. For one-step-ahead forecasts, the information set is readily available. For multi-step-ahead forecasts, we need to come up with the value of the variable that has not been realized yet. For example, when making a two-step-ahead forecast for period \\(t+2\\), we need data from period \\(t+1\\), which is not available at the time when the forecast is made. Instead, we need to use our forecast for period \\(t+1\\). The same applies to forecasts for any subsequent periods in the future. This approach is known as an iterative method of forecasting, wherein we make forecast for some period using the available data, then iterate forward by one period and use the most recent forecast to make the next periods forecast, and so on and so forth. 6.2.1 One-step-ahead forecast from AR(1) The realization of the random variable in period \\(t+1\\) is: \\[y_{t+1} = \\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t} + \\varepsilon_{t+1}\\] The optimal one-step-ahead forecast is: \\[y_{t+1|t} = E(y_{t+1}|\\Omega_t) = E(\\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t} + \\varepsilon_{t+1}) = \\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t}\\] The one-step-ahead forecast error is: \\[e_{t+1|t} = y_{t+1} - y_{t+1|t} = \\alpha + \\beta_1 y_t + \\varepsilon_{t+1} - (\\alpha + \\beta_1 y_t) = \\varepsilon_{t+1}\\] The one-step-ahead forecast variance: \\[\\sigma_{t+1|t}^2 = Var(y_{t+1}|\\Omega_t) = E(e_{t+1|t}^2) = E(\\varepsilon_{t+1}^2) = \\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^2\\] The one-step-ahead (95%) interval forecast: \\[y_{t+1|t} \\pm z_{.025}\\sigma_{t+1|t} = y_{t+1|t} \\pm 1.96\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}\\] 6.2.2 Two-step-ahead forecast from AR(1) The realization of the random variable in period \\(t+2\\) is: \\[y_{t+2} = \\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t+1} + \\varepsilon_{t+2}\\] The optimal two-step-ahead forecast is: \\[y_{t+2|t} = E(y_{t+2}|\\Omega_t) = E(\\alpha + \\beta_1 y_{t+1} + \\varepsilon_{t+2}) = \\alpha(1+\\beta_1) + \\beta_1^2 y_t\\] Note, that here we substituted \\(y_{t+1}\\) with \\(\\alpha + \\beta_1 y_t + \\varepsilon_{t+1}\\).

For example, changes to household income impact their consumption levels; changes to interest rates impact investments in the economy. Often (albeit not always) the relationship between the variables goes in both directions. For example, higher wages (and, therefore, income) result in higher prices (inflation), which in turn puts an upward pressure on wages. The foregoing implies that a shock to a variable may propagate a dynamic response not only of that variable, but also of related variables. The dynamic linkages between two (or more) economic variables can be modeled as a system of equations, represented by a vector autoregressive (VAR) process. 7.1 Modeling To begin, consider a bivariate (two-dimensional) VAR of order one, VAR(1). Let \\(\\{X_{1,t}\\}\\) and \\(\\{X_{2,t}\\}\\) be the stationary stochastic processes. A bivariate VAR(1), is then given by: \\[\\begin{aligned} x_{1,t} &amp;= \\alpha_1 + \\pi_{11}x_{1,t-1} + \\pi_{12}x_{2,t-1} + \\varepsilon_{1,t} \\\\ x_{2,t} &amp;= \\alpha_2 + \\pi_{21}x_{1,t-1} + \\pi_{22}x_{2,t-1} + \\varepsilon_{2,t} \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\varepsilon_{1,t} \\sim iid(0,\\sigma_1^2)\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{2,t} \\sim iid(0,\\sigma_2^2)\\), and the two can be correlated, i.e., \\(Cov(\\varepsilon_{1,t},\\varepsilon_{2,t}) \\neq 0\\). To generalize, consider a multivariate (\\(n\\)-dimensional) VAR of order \\(p\\), VAR(p), presented in matrix notation: \\[\\mathbf{x}_t = \\mathbf{\\alpha} + \\Pi_1 \\mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \\ldots + \\Pi_p \\mathbf{x}_{t-p} + \\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_t,\\] where \\(\\mathbf{x}_t = (x_{1,t},\\ldots,x_{n,t})&#39;\\) is a vector of \\(n\\) (potentially) related variables; \\(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_t = (\\varepsilon_{1,t},\\ldots,\\varepsilon_{n,t})&#39;\\) is a vector of error terms, such that \\(E(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_t) = \\mathbf{0}\\), \\(E(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_t^{}\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_t^{\\prime}) = \\Sigma\\), and \\(E(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_{t}^{}\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}_{s \\neq t}^{\\prime}) = 0\\). \\(\\Pi_1,\\ldots,\\Pi_p\\) are \\(n\\)-dimensional parameter matrices: \\[\\Pi_j = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\pi_{11j} &amp; \\pi_{12j} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\pi_{1nj} \\\\ \\pi_{21j} &amp; \\pi_{22j} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\pi_{2nj} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\pi_{n1j} &amp; \\pi_{n2j} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\pi_{nnj} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right],\\;~~j=1,\\ldots,p\\] When two or more variables are modeled in this way, the implies assumption is that these variables are endogenous to each other; that is, each of the variables affects and is affected by other variables. There are three forms of vector autoregressions: structural, recursive, and reduced-form. The structural VAR uses economic theory to impose the structure on correlations of the error terms in the system, thus, facilitate their causal interpretation. The recursive VAR also introduces a structure of some sort, which primarily involves ordering the equations in the system in a specific way so that the error terms in each equation are uncorrelated with those in the preceding equations. To the extent that the identifying assumptions are satisfied, some contemporaneous values (of other variables) appear in the equation of a given variable. The reduced-form VAR makes no claims of causality, instead it only includes lagged values of all the variables in each equation of the system. To the extent that the variables entering the system are, indeed, correlated among each other, the error terms of the reduced-form VAR (typically) are contemporaneously correlated. Here, unless otherwise specified, VAR refers to the reduced-form VAR. Some of the features of the VAR are that: only lagged values of the dependent variables are considered as the right-hand-side variables (although, trend and seasonal variables might also be included in higher-frequency data analysis); each equation has the same set of right-hand-side variables (however, it is possible to impose a different lag structure across the equations, especially when \\(p\\) is relatively large, to preserve the degrees of freedom, particularly when the sample size is relatively small and when there are several variables in the system). The autregressive order of the VAR, \\(p\\), is determined by the maximum lag of a variable across all equations. The order of a VAR, \\(p\\), can be determined using system-wide information criteria: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; AIC = \\ln\\left|\\Sigma_{\\varepsilon}\\right| + \\frac{2}{T}(pn^2+n) \\\\ &amp; SIC = \\ln\\left|\\Sigma_{\\varepsilon}\\right| + \\frac{\\ln{T}}{T}(pn^2+n) \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\left|\\Sigma_{\\varepsilon}\\right|\\) is the determinant of the residual covariance matrix; \\(n\\) is the number of equations, and \\(T\\) is the effective sample size. We can estimate each equation of the VAR individually using OLS. 7.1.1 In-Sample Granger Causality A test of joint significance of parameters associated with all the lags of a variable entering the equation of another variable is known as the Granger causality test. The use of the term causality in this context has been criticized. That one variable can help explain the movement of another variable does not necessarily mean that the former causes the latter. To that end the use of the term is misleading, indeed. Rather, it simply means that the former helps predict the latter, and that is, in effect, the meaning of causality in Granger sense. To illustrate the testing framework, consider a bivariate VAR(p): \\[\\begin{aligned} x_{1,t} &amp;= \\alpha_1 + \\pi_{111} x_{1,t-1} + \\cdots + \\pi_{11p} x_{1,t-p} \\\\ &amp;+ \\pi_{121} x_{2,t-1} + \\cdots + \\pi_{12p} x_{2,t-p} +\\varepsilon_{1,t} \\\\ x_{2,t} &amp;= \\alpha_1 + \\pi_{211} x_{1,t-1} + \\cdots + \\pi_{21p} x_{1,t-p} \\\\ &amp;+ \\pi_{221} x_{2,t-1} + \\cdots + \\pi_{22p} x_{2,t-p} +\\varepsilon_{2,t} \\end{aligned}\\] It is said that: - \\(\\{X_2\\}\\) does not Granger cause \\(\\{X_1\\}\\) if \\(\\pi_{121}=\\cdots=\\pi_{12p}=0\\) - \\(\\{X_1\\}\\) does not Granger cause \\(\\{X_2\\}\\) if \\(\\pi_{211}=\\cdots=\\pi_{21p}=0\\) So long as the variables of the system are covariance-stationarity, we can apply a F test for the hypotheses testing. If \\(p=1\\), a t test is equivalently applicable for hypotheses testing. 7.2 Forecasting Generating forecasts for each of the variable comprising the VAR(p) model can be a straightforward exercise, so long as we have access to the relevant information set. As it was the case with autoregressive models, we make one-step-ahead forecasts based on the readily available data; and we make multi-step-ahead forecasts iteratively, using the forecast in periods for which the data are not present. 7.2.1 One-step-ahead forecast from bivariate VAR(1) The realizations of the variables in period \\(t+1\\) are: \\[\\begin{aligned} x_{1,t+1} &amp;= \\alpha_1 + \\pi_{11} x_{1,t} + \\pi_{12} x_{2,t} + \\varepsilon_{1,t+1} \\\\ x_{2,t+1} &amp;= \\alpha_2 + \\pi_{21} x_{1,t} + \\pi_{22} x_{2,t} + \\varepsilon_{2,t+1} \\end{aligned}\\] The optimal one-step-ahead forecasts are: \\[\\begin{aligned} x_{1,t+1|t} &amp;= E(x_{1,t+1}|\\Omega_t) = \\alpha_1 + \\pi_{11} x_{1,t} + \\pi_{12} x_{2,t} \\\\ x_{2,t+1|t} &amp;= E(x_{2,t+1}|\\Omega_t) = \\alpha_2 + \\pi_{21} x_{1,t} + \\pi_{22} x_{2,t} \\end{aligned}\\] The one-step-ahead forecast errors are: \\[\\begin{aligned} e_{1,t+1|t} &amp;= x_{1,t+1} - x_{1,t+1|t} = \\varepsilon_{1,t+1} \\\\ e_{2,t+1|t} &amp;= x_{2,t+1} - x_{2,t+1|t} = \\varepsilon_{2,t+1} \\end{aligned}\\] The one-step-ahead forecast variances are: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\sigma_{1,t+1|t}^2 &amp;= E(x_{1,t+1} - x_{1,t+1|t}|\\Omega_t)^2 = E(\\varepsilon_{1,t+1}^2) = \\sigma_{1}^2 \\\\ \\sigma_{2,t+1|t}^2 &amp;= E(x_{2,t+1} - x_{2,t+1|t}|\\Omega_t)^2 = E(\\varepsilon_{2,t+1}^2) = \\sigma_{2}^2 \\end{aligned}\\] The one-step-ahead (95%) interval forecasts are: \\[\\begin{aligned} x_{1,t+1|t} \\pm z_{.025}\\sigma_{1,t+1|t} = x_{1,t+1|t} \\pm 1.96\\sigma_{\\varepsilon_1} \\\\ x_{2,t+1|t} \\pm z_{.025}\\sigma_{2,t+1|t} = x_{2,t+1|t} \\pm 1.96\\sigma_{\\varepsilon_2} \\end{aligned}\\] 7.2.2 Two-step-ahead forecast from bivariate VAR(1) The realizations of the variables in period \\(t+2\\) are: \\[\\begin{aligned} x_{1,t+2} &amp;= \\alpha_1 + \\pi_{11} x_{1,t+1} + \\pi_{12} x_{2,t+1} + \\varepsilon_{1,t+2} \\\\ x_{2,t+2} &amp;= \\alpha_2 + \\pi_{21} x_{1,t+1} + \\pi_{22} x_{2,t+1} + \\varepsilon_{2,t+2} \\end{aligned}\\] The optimal two-step-ahead forecasts are: \\[\\begin{aligned} x_{1,t+2|t} &amp;= E(x_{1,t+2}|\\Omega_t) = \\alpha_1 + \\pi_{11} x_{1,t+1|t} + \\pi_{12} x_{2,t+1|t} \\\\ x_{2,t+2|t} &amp;= E(x_{2,t+2}|\\Omega_t) = \\alpha_2 + \\pi_{21} x_{1,t+1|t} + \\pi_{22} x_{2,t+1|t} \\end{aligned}\\] The two-step-ahead forecast errors are: \\[\\begin{aligned} e_{1,t+2|t} &amp;= x_{1,t+2} - x_{1,t+2|t} = \\pi_{11} e_{1,t+1|t} + \\pi_{12} e_{2,t+1|t} + \\varepsilon_{1,t+2} \\\\ e_{2,t+2|t} &amp;= x_{2,t+2} - x_{2,t+2|t} = \\pi_{21} e_{1,t+1|t} + \\pi_{22} e_{2,t+1|t} + \\varepsilon_{2,t+2} \\end{aligned}\\] The two-step-ahead forecast variances are: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\sigma_{1,t+2|t}^2 &amp;= E(x_{1,t+2} - x_{1,t+2|t}|\\Omega_t)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sigma_{1}^2(1+\\pi_{11}^2) + \\sigma_{2}^2\\pi_{12}^2 + 2\\pi_{11}\\pi_{12} Cov(\\varepsilon_{1},\\varepsilon_{2})\\\\ \\sigma_{2,t+2|t}^2 &amp;= E(x_{2,t+2} - x_{2,t+2|t}|\\Omega_t)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sigma_{2}^2(1+\\pi_{22}^2) + \\sigma_{1}^2\\pi_{21}^2 + 2\\pi_{21}\\pi_{22} Cov(\\varepsilon_{1},\\varepsilon_{2}) \\end{aligned}\\] The two-step-ahead (95%) interval forecasts are: \\[\\begin{aligned} x_{1,t+2|t} \\pm z_{.025}\\sigma_{1,t+2|t} \\\\ x_{2,t+2|t} \\pm z_{.025}\\sigma_{2,t+2|t} \\end{aligned}\\] 7.2.3 Out-of-Sample Granger Causality The previously discussed (in sample) test of causality in Granger sense is frequently performed in practice. But as noted above, the term causality may be misleading somewhat. Indeed, the true spirit of such test is to assess the ability of a variable to help predict another variable in an out-of-sample setting. Consider the restricted and unrestricted information sets, where the former only contains information on variable \\(X_1\\), while the latter contains the same information as well as information on variable \\(X_2\\): \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\Omega_{t,r} \\equiv \\Omega_{t}(X_1) = \\{x_{1,t},x_{1,t-1},\\ldots\\} \\\\ &amp;\\Omega_{t,u} \\equiv \\Omega_{t}(X_1,X_2) = \\{x_{1,t},x_{1,t-1},\\ldots,x_{2,t},x_{2,t-1},\\ldots\\} \\end{aligned}\\] Following Grangers definition of causality: \\(\\{X_2\\}\\) is said to cause \\(\\{X_1\\}\\) if \\(\\sigma_{x_1}^2\\left(\\Omega_{t,u}\\right) &lt; \\sigma_{x_1}^2\\left(\\Omega_{t,r}\\right)\\), meaning that we can better predict \\(X_1\\) using all available information on \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), rather than that on \\(X_1\\) only. Let the forecasts based on each of the information sets be: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;x_{1,t+h|t,r} = E\\left(x_{1,t+h}|\\Omega_{t,r}\\right) \\\\ &amp;x_{1,t+h|t,u} = E\\left(x_{1,t+h}|\\Omega_{t,u}\\right) \\end{aligned}\\] For these forecasts, the corresponding forecast errors are: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; e_{1,t+h|t,r} = x_{1,t+h} - x_{1,t+h|t,r}\\\\ &amp; e_{1,t+h|t,u} = x_{1,t+h} - x_{1,t+h|t,u} \\end{aligned}\\] The out-of-sample forecast errors are then evaluated by comparing the loss functions based on these forecasts errors. For example, assuming quadratic loss, and \\(P\\) out-of-sample forecasts: \\[\\begin{aligned} RMSFE_{r} &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{P}\\sum_{s=1}^{P}\\left(e_{1,R+s|R-1+s,r}\\right)^2} \\\\ RMSFE_{u} &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{P}\\sum_{s=1}^{P}\\left(e_{1,R+s|R-1+s,u}\\right)^2} \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(R\\) is the size of the (first) estimation window. \\(\\{X_2\\}\\) is said to cause in Granger sense \\(\\{X_1\\}\\) if \\(RMSFE_{u} &lt; RMSFE_{r}\\).

Here I introduce basic commands that should facilitate your understanding of R. You can further enhance your skillset using numerous online resources, as well as your own trialanderror. To the extent that new features are added to R on a daily basis, there are virtually no limits to how far you can advance your knowledge of this programming language. We will work in RStudiothe go-to interface for R (as R itself is not an overly user-friendly platform). Thus, you will need to have installed both, R and RStudio on your devise (the latter will find and connect with the former on its own). R is available from CRAN, and RStudio is available from RStudio. Data Management There are a number of ways in which we can work with data in R. Lets begin with matrices. Consider a string of observations: a &lt;- c(1,0,4,3,2,6) a ## [1] 1 0 4 3 2 6 A string, unlike a vector, has no dimensions. But we can transform it to a \\(n \\times 1\\) vector using the as.matrix() function: b &lt;- as.matrix(a) b ## [,1] ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 0 ## [3,] 4 ## [4,] 3 ## [5,] 2 ## [6,] 6 The result is a \\(6 \\times 1\\) vector, or a column matrix. To obtain a \\(1 \\times 6\\) vector, or a row matrix, we transpose the foregoing vector using the t() function: bt &lt;- t(b) bt ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 4 3 2 6 dim(bt) ## [1] 1 6 We can create any \\(n \\times k\\) matrix, using the matrix() function. For example, consider a \\(3 \\times 2\\) matrix: B &lt;- matrix(a,nrow=3,ncol=2) B ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 3 ## [2,] 0 2 ## [3,] 4 6 We can add column names and row names to this matrix: colnames(B) &lt;- c(&quot;c1&quot;,&quot;c2&quot;) rownames(B) &lt;- c(&quot;r1&quot;,&quot;r2&quot;,&quot;r3&quot;) B ## c1 c2 ## r1 1 3 ## r2 0 2 ## r3 4 6 If, at this point, we would like to only work with, say, the first column of the matrix, we can call it using its column number, (1), or the column name, (c1), as follows: B[,&quot;c1&quot;] ## r1 r2 r3 ## 1 0 4 Similarly, if we want to refer to a matrix element, say \\(b_{3,2}\\), we can do this as follows: B[3,2] ## [1] 6 Matrix multiplication is done using %*% command, granted that the two matrices are compatible. For example, we obtain a product of matrix \\(B\\) and a new \\(2 \\times 1\\) vector, \\(d\\), as follows: d &lt;- as.matrix(c(5,-2)) Bd &lt;- B%*%d Bd ## [,1] ## r1 -1 ## r2 -4 ## r3 8 We can add columns (and rows) to the existing matrix using a cbind() function: c3 &lt;- c(0,1,0) D &lt;- cbind(B,c3) D ## c1 c2 c3 ## r1 1 3 0 ## r2 0 2 1 ## r3 4 6 0 We can invert a(n invertible) matrix using the solve() function: Di &lt;- solve(D) Di ## r1 r2 r3 ## c1 -1.0000000 0 0.5000000 ## c2 0.6666667 0 -0.1666667 ## c3 -1.3333333 1 0.3333333 Data Visualisation One of the comparative advantages of R is in its graphing aesthetics. Currently, the best graphs are plotted via the ggplot2 package. Notably, this package requires that the data are maintained in the data.frame or the data.table format (for the latter, you need to load the data.table package). Lets create a data.table object and observe its few lines: set.seed(1) x &lt;- runif(120,0,2) y &lt;- 0.2+0.7*x+rnorm(120) library(data.table) dt &lt;- data.table(y=y,x=x) dt ## y x ## 1: 2.9733299 0.53101733 ## 2: 0.6817335 0.74424780 ## 3: 1.6917341 1.14570673 ## 4: 1.4994931 1.81641558 ## 5: -0.2609185 0.40336386 ## --- ## 116: 0.1835826 0.02615515 ## 117: 1.9894321 1.43113213 ## 118: 2.4197029 0.20636847 ## 119: 1.8521905 0.89256870 ## 120: 2.3040499 1.28020209 Now, lets load ggplot2 and generate a simple scatter plot: library(ggplot2) ggplot(dt,aes(x=x,y=y))+ geom_point() We can augment this plot in a number of different ways. Here we change the point color to red, add the fitted regression line to the plot, add labels to the figure, and apply a classic background theme: ggplot(dt,aes(x=x,y=y))+ geom_point(color=&quot;goldenrod&quot;)+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,formula=y~x,se=F,color=&quot;darkgray&quot;)+ labs(title=&quot;A scatterplot with fitted regression line&quot;, x=&quot;Treatment Variable&quot;, y=&quot;Outcome Variable&quot;, caption=&quot;Caption: in case if needed.&quot;)+ theme_classic() As another example, lets generate a histogram (of the dependent variable): ggplot(dt,aes(x=y))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;,fill=&quot;goldenrod&quot;,binwidth=.5)+ labs(title=&quot;A basic histogram&quot;)+ theme_classic() We typically apply a line plot to illustrate a time series (that are ordered by date). In what follows, we add a date column to our data frame and then plot the dependent variable in the chronological order: dt$date &lt;- seq(from=as.Date(&quot;2000-01-01&quot;),by=&quot;month&quot;,along.with=y) ggplot(dt,aes(x=date,y=y))+ geom_line(color=&quot;goldenrod&quot;)+ labs(title=&quot;A basic time series plot&quot;, x=&quot;Year&quot;, y=&quot;Outcome Variable&quot;)+ theme_classic() Regression Analysis To illustrate the OLS regression in R, we apply the previously generated \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as independent and dependent variables. To begin, we obtain the least squares estimator by hand as follows: X &lt;- cbind(1,x) b &lt;- solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%y b ## [,1] ## 0.3577680 ## x 0.5781188 This can be easily done using the lm() function: ols &lt;- lm(y~x) ols ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) x ## 0.3578 0.5781 We can apply the summary() function to see the complete set of regression results: summary(ols) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.9662 -0.5983 -0.1127 0.5639 2.3882 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Lets generate a sequence of 200 iid random variables with mean zero and variance 4, call it e. set.seed(1) e &lt;- rnorm(200,0,2) Notice that prior to sampling we set seed to some value (to one in this instance).
