# Foreword {-}

'Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.' -- a perfect quote about our inability to make a perfect forecast, often attributed to Niels Bohr, is very much on-brand for the study of forecasting. And so it goes.

I came across this quote as I was wrapping up my doctoral dissertation at Purdue University. My dissertation topic was 'Nonlinear Multivariate Modeling and Forecasting of Commodity Prices.' When I started my doctoral degree, I had not taken a designated time series econometrics or forecasting course. By the time I was completing my degree, I had learned enough to know how difficult it was to achieve accurate forecasts. A chapter of my dissertation, which pretty much was a forecasting exercise, yielded the so-called 'null results.' I felt uneasy about it. I had an urge to justify, somehow, these null results. And then I stumbled across this quote, which 'saved my day.' I stuck it as an epigraph of my dissertation. It captured my struggles as a forecaster, and provided the context to the results of my work. 

Some years later, as I started teaching a course on forecasting, I spend a great deal of time explaining---indeed preparing students for the inevitable---that forecasting is difficult, and that more often than not we will not be able to give accurate forecasts. But I also stress that this should not discourage us from trying because most great achievements in this world have myriads of failed attempts as a foundation. 

What is forecast if not a guess? An educated guess, nonetheless. A good guess doesn't have to be spot-on. It almost never is, only if by fluke. In fact, an inaccurate guess can be helpful too. That we were unable to exactly predict an event, tells us something about the underlying processes that result in an outcome different from what we predicted. Such conjecture can be useful. Forecasting, even if inaccurate, can be useful. George Box's 'all models are wrong but some are useful' is certainly suitable to the study of forecasting. This book introduces time series models and presents a case of their usefulness in predicting events.
