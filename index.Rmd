# Foreword {-}

`r newthought('What is forecast')` if not a guess? An educated guess, nonetheless. A good guess doesn't have to be precise. It almost never is, only if by fluke. An imprecise guess can be of value to a forecaster. That we were unable to exactly predict an event, tells us something about the underlying processes that result in an outcome different from what we predicted. Such conjecture can be useful. Forecasting, even if inaccurate, can be useful. George Box's 'all models are wrong but some are useful' is certainly suitable to the study of forecasting.

Our inability to make perfect forecasts is best summarized in a quote typically attributed to Niels Bohr:^[The exact origin of this saying, or its variant, is somewhat murky. It appears to had been adopted from a Danish proverb.] 'it is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.' I came across this quote as I was wrapping up my doctoral dissertation at Purdue University. The title of my dissertation was 'Nonlinear Multivariate Modeling and Forecasting of Commodity Prices.' A chapter of my dissertation, which was largely a forecasting exercise, yielded the so-called 'null result.' I felt uneasy about it. I had an urge to justify, somehow, this null result. And then I stumbled across this quote, which 'saved my day.' I stuck it as an epigraph of my dissertation. It captured my struggles as a forecaster, and provided the context to the results of my work. 

Some years later, I started teaching a course on economic forecasting. As I introduce the subject, I tend to spend a great deal of time explaining---indeed preparing students for the inevitable---that forecasting is difficult, and that more often than not we will not be able to give accurate forecasts. But I also stress that this should not discourage us from trying, as most great achievements in this world have myriads of failed attempts as a foundation. And in any case, a forecast---however inaccurate---is a successful outcome of a thought process.

This book introduces econometric models of time series data with a specific emphasis on the use of these models in predicting future realizations of the data.
