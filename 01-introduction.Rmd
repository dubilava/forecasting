`r newthought('Roots of forecasting')` extend very much to the beginning of human history. In their desire to predict the future, people have attempted to make forecasts of their own, or have used services of others. Fortunetellers, for example, have been forecast experts of some sort, basing their predictions on magic. They are less common in the current age. Astrologers, who rely on astronomical phenomena to foresee the future, maintain their relevance to this date. 

Over time, and particularly with the development of the study of econometrics, more rigorous forecasting methods have been introduced and developed. All methods -- primitive or complex, spurious or scientifically substantiated -- have one thing in common: they all rely (or, at least, pretend to rely) on *information*.

Information is key in forecasting. It comes in many forms, and is summarized in *data*. When organized and stored in a certain way -- chronologically and at regular intervals -- we end up with *time series* data. A diverse set of forecasting methods typically rely on insights from econometric analysis of time series data. In time series analysis, the implied assumption is that the past tends to repeat itself, at least to some extent. So, if we well study the past, we may be able to forecast an event with some degree of accuracy. 

Accurate forecasting is difficult. Indeed, forecasting is difficult because of all the unknowns we deal with in the process.^['*As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsâ€”the ones we don't know we don't know.*'
--- Donald Ramsfeld] As a result, there is no such thing as precise forecast, even if by fluke we were to exactly predict an outcome of an event. But some forecasts, on average, are better than others. And in search of such forecasts the study of time series econometrics has evolved.
